# SoSe 2023: Master-Praktikum: Efficient Programming of Multicore Processors and Supercomputers (IN2106, IN2397, IN4048)

This is a repository for storing data, source, and submission of the lab course shown in the title. 

The lab contains two final projects and some weekly assignments. The first project we work on is the parallelization of a heat simulation in a solid body. This application will first be optimized for sequential execution, then be parallelized with OpenMP and finally with MPI. The second project is the parallelization of the game Abalone. we parallelize with Alpha/Beta search strategy. This strategies determines the best next move for a player. We also add different optimizations to win in the final Tournament with other groups. The lab course also contains Profiling with PAPI and vtune. We use the SuperMUC at LRZ which has a peak performance of 3 petaflop, one of the fastest computers in Germany.
